<h1>Agent Zero</h1>

<h3>About This Project</h3>
<p align="justify">Agent Zero initially started as a project assignment for Game Programming and Serious Games. Afterwards, I kept working on this project.</p>

<h3>Project Info</h3>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p align="justify">Agent Zero is a two-dimensional platformer video game where players can experience a realistic flood simulation and learn about the factors that cause floods, such as improper waste disposal. The game is designed for PC users. Players are tasked with avoiding obstacles caused by the flood and collecting trash in their environment. The game ends if all trash is collected and no flood occurs, or if a flood happens and the player loses.</p>

<h3>About Game</h3>
Agent Zero is a prototype game themed around **Natural Disasters** and **Education**. The game currently has two levels, and the levels are connected to each other, so what you do on level 1 will have consequences on another level. This is my third game built using the Unity Engine. It's not perfect, but it still has its ups and downs, and I will finish the game soon.

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p align="justify">The gameplay of this game is side scroll themed. You can move the player left and right, and you can grab and drop trash scatter in the area.
The purpose of this game to make habit, educate that trash, garbages is not something you can ignore. On the second level, earthquake hits, and heavy rain falls.
All you do on the previous level will impact this level, basically, the more trash you ignore, the harder the level gets. But it still on prototype so this feature is still not done.</p>

# Game Mechanics I Created
<h3>Simple Recycling System</h3>
<p align="justify">The recycling system allows players to interact with trash objects in the environment by grabbing and dropping them into designated recycling bins. This mechanic encourages players to sort waste properly, reinforcing the game’s educational message on the importance of recycling and environmental responsibility.</p>

<h3>Simple Save File System</h3>
<p align="justify">The save file system utilizes JSON to store player information, such as names entered at the start of the game. This system ensures that each player’s data is securely saved, enabling personalized experiences and progress tracking whenever the game is played.</p>

<h3>What I Learned From Make This Game</h3>
<p align="justify">Working on Agent Zero has been a valuable learning experience, particularly in areas related to optimization, resource management, and creating efficient game mechanics. Throughout the project, I’ve deepened my understanding of performance profiling in Unity and have applied strategies to minimize memory usage, which aligns with my personal interest in game optimization. Additionally, implementing various level interactions and educational elements pushed me to explore different problem-solving techniques, allowing me to address complex challenges in smaller, more manageable chunks. I used to spend a lot of time making my code overly modular and abstract in anticipation of future additions. However, while working on Agent Zero, I adopted a more straightforward approach, focusing on building only what’s necessary to meet the current requirements. This shift not only streamlined my workflow but also gave me more flexibility to iterate and improve the game as new ideas emerged. I plan to continue refining this method in future projects, prioritizing practical solutions and refactoring when necessary.</p>
