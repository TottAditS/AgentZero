<p>
  Agent Zero is a two-dimensional platformer video game 
  where players can experience a realistic flood simulation and learn 
  about the factors that cause floods, such as improper waste disposal. 
  The game is designed for PC users. Players are tasked with avoiding 
  obstacles caused by the flood and collecting trash in their environment. 
  The game ends if all trash is collected and no flood occurs, or if a 
  flood happens and the player loses.

<h3>About Game</h3>
Agent Zero is a Prototype game themed Natural Disaster, Educational Game. The game for now has two level. And the levels are connected to each other, so what you do on level 1 will have
consequences on another level. This is my third game built using Unity Engine, it's not perfect, still have ups and downs, and i will finish the game soon.

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
The gameplay of this game is side scroll themed. You can move the player left and right, and you can grab and drop trash scatter in the area.
The purpose of this game to make habit, educate that trash, garbages is not something you can ignore. On the second level, earthquake hits, and heavy rain falls.
All you do on the previous level will impact this level, basically, the more trash you ignore, the harder the level gets. But it still on prototype so this feature is still not done.
