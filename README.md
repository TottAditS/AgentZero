# Bug Shooter

## About
Bug Shooter initially started as a gradable assignment for a FutureGames course. Afterwards, I kept working on the project, adding a second spatial data structure to compare the results and a background generator by using the Wave Function Collapse algorithm.

## Introduction
This space shooter game was a fun and challenging project for me, where I had the opportunity to work on creating my own ECS in C++, focusing on **optimization** and getting a better understanding of the Performance Profiler in Visual Studio.

In order to gain a better understanding of procedural generation, I wanted to build a background generator using the **Wave Function Collapse** algorithm. I decided on the wave function collapse algorithm because it appealed the most to me, and it can be used in a variety of ways.

Additionally, I added both a **spatial hash** and a **quadtree** as spatial data structures so that I could compare how well both of them performed. This was a fun and interesting learning experience that gave me a better understanding of the advantages and disadvantages between the two.

Working on a project by myself was a fun and educational experience, as I was able to fully focus on the development process and learn a lot during the process. However, **I prefer working with a team** as it allows for a more dynamic and collaborative work environment, where I can bounce ideas off others and learn from their diverse perspectives and expertise.


<p>
  Agent Zero is a two-dimensional platformer video game 
  where players can experience a realistic flood simulation and learn 
  about the factors that cause floods, such as improper waste disposal. 
  The game is designed for PC users. Players are tasked with avoiding 
  obstacles caused by the flood and collecting trash in their environment. 
  The game ends if all trash is collected and no flood occurs, or if a 
  flood happens and the player loses.

<h3>About Game</h3>
Agent Zero is a Prototype game themed Natural Disaster, Educational Game. The game for now has two level. And the levels are connected to each other, so what you do on level 1 will have
consequences on another level. This is my third game built using Unity Engine, it's not perfect, still have ups and downs, and i will finish the game soon.

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
The gameplay of this game is side scroll themed. You can move the player left and right, and you can grab and drop trash scatter in the area.
The purpose of this game to make habit, educate that trash, garbages is not something you can ignore. On the second level, earthquake hits, and heavy rain falls.
All you do on the previous level will impact this level, basically, the more trash you ignore, the harder the level gets. But it still on prototype so this feature is still not done.

<h3>Controls</h3>
If VsPlayer, For P1:
A - Left
D - Right
G - Grab and drop item
Space - Jump

<h3>Setup</h3>
- You dont have to download all of the repository, if you just want to play, just download the folder named "Builded"
- Open Folder named "Builded", and open the .exe file to run the game
